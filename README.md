# Storm Debian Packaging

Debian packaging for [Apache Storm](http://storm.incubator.apache.org) distributed
realtime computation system.

The goal of this project is to provide a flexible tool to build a debian package,
that follows debian standards, uses default configs, supplied with storm release.
And also can be used as easy as storm zip unpacked elsewhere, and, at the same time,
provides a flexibility to configure it for long-term high-load production use.

I have [previously](https://github.com/pershyn/storm-deb-packaging) used
[FPM](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/) to build storm 0.8 till 0.9.1.
But it was hard to maintain and also messy, while there were only potential benefits
to parametrize build for ubuntu (upstart) and theoretically rpm.

Also, before 0.9.1 building storm involved building zmq and jzmq packages.
That was a pain, details [here](https://github.com/pershyn/storm-deb-packaging/blob/37bca226b8183e86d63b40c33ffd776b7b105c23/README.md#zeromq-and-jzmq).
Now these dependencies are gone and [storm flies with netty](http://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/64758709722/making-storm-fly-with-netty) by default.

Before you proceed to build a package, you may be interested to keep in mind next projects.

## Building a package:

1. Clone the repository and edit the `storm-deb-packaging/debian/changelog` to set packaging version/maintainer to your prefered values, so you get contacted if other people will use the package compiled by you.
2. Prepare the environment. You should have debian-based distribution with all tools listed in `bootstrap.sh` installed. Also, Vagrant is recommended, please find details below.
3. Make sure you have desired versions specified in `debian/rules` file and `debian/changelog`. _By default the version `apache-storm-0.9.3` will be built._
4. Run the `build.sh`. It will go to nested folder `storm-deb-packaging` and execute the `dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot`. The sources will be downloaded as specified in `rules` file and package would be then created in `../`. In case you want to build SNAPSHOT version - follow the instructions in next paragraph.
5. [Optional] After you have built a package, run the next command to display package layout. Pass-in your package version:
```
$ dpkg -c /vagrant/apache-storm_*_all.deb > SAMPLE_LAYOUT.txt
```
The sample layout can be found in the [SAMPLE_LAYOUT.txt](SAMPLE_LAYOUT.txt) file in repository.

<a name="building-a-package-from-storm-snapshot"></a>
### Creating a package of SNAPSHOT version of storm.

Follow instructions in [storm/DEVELOPER.md](https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md#packaging) to create a storm distribution.

    # First, build the code.
    $ mvn clean install  # you may skip tests with `-DskipTests=true` to save time

    # Create the binary distribution.
    $ cd storm-dist/binary && mvn package

Then copy `storm-dist/binary/target/apache-storm-<version>.zip` to `storm-deb-packaging/downloads` and edit the `debian/rules` and `debian/changelog` files to use this zip.

<a name="using-a-package"></a>
## Using a package:

According to [official storm guide](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/wiki/Setting-up-a-Storm-cluster)
you have to have next things installed:
- Java 6. But, according to [recent info](https://www.mail-archive.com/user@storm.incubator.apache.org/msg03230.html), storm-0.9.x works perfectly with java 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8. Also both openjdk and oracle jdk are supported.
- Python 2.6.6 - It may work also with other version, however this one claimed to be tested.

During the installation storm package also creates or enables existing storm user.

1. After you install a package - edit the `/etc/storm/storm.yaml` to specify nimbus and zookeeper path.
Configure storm the way you need also using `/etc/storm/storm_env.ini`.
It is a good idea to use Software Configuration Management tools to manage configuration of storm clusters.
2. Start required service with corresponding command. For example:
```
# /etc/init.d/storm-nimbus start
# /etc/init.d/storm-ui start
# /etc/init.d/storm-supervisor start
# /etc/init.d/storm-drpc start
# /etc/init.d/storm-logviewer start
```
3. Enable those that you need to start automatically on system restart using `insserv` or `update-rc.d`. __The current package ensures the storm services are disabled after install. Needed services should be then enabled manually/explicitly.__ Please read below, why it is made so.

4. As already mentioned, it is a good idea to use software configuration management tools to manage configuration of storm clusters. Take a look at [saltstack](http://www.saltstack.com/), [ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home), [chef](http://www.getchef.com/chef/), [puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/).

5. On updates the package will stop the running services, and also clear the `storm-local` for workers and supervisors, but *will keep `storm-local` for nimbus* in order to awoid implicit killing of the topology (in case the update is done to bugfix-versions). After the update is done, the *services should be enabled*.

<a name="compatibility"></a>
### Compatibity:

* This version is intended to be used against apache-storm 0.9.3 and Debian Wheezy. Presumably it can be ran on any other debian-based distribution, because relies only on LSB. It has also upstart's conf files.
* There are previous versions (up to 0.9.1) built with FPM [here](https://github.com/pershyn/storm-deb-packaging). See tags/branches and forks.
* This version started from 0.9.2, so you may find interesting configuration in history.

<a name="technical-details"></a>
## Details:

<a name="multiple-services-in-one-package"></a>
### Multiple services in one package.

The storm distribution can be ran in many roles: supervisor, nimbus, etc. There are two approaches to provide packaged `apache-storm`.

The first one is to have __one package per service__ and common package with common stuff for all services. 6 in total.
Then 5 packages that will depend on `common` and will provide corresponding
services each: `storm-supervisor`, `storm-nimbus`, `storm-drpc`, `storm-drpc` and `storm-logviewer`.
The one, that will be needed on a node, can be then installed.

Another approach is to provide __all services in one package__, and then just enable required depending on the node role.
For example, we need a cluster of 20 nodes, where 2 of them will provide roles of nimbus and UI.
So we install a package on all of them, and then just enable needed roles using `insserv` or `update-rc.d`: storm-supervisors on 20 of them, storm-nimbus and storm-ui on 2.

To keep the packaging simpler and also because storm is compiled in one jar and reuses a lots of components, the approach of packaging all services in one package is taken.

<a name="storm-home-user-home-and-local-dir"></a>
### $STORM_HOME, storm user home, and storm.local.dir.

Basically there are 2 folders (except configs, logs and init scripts):

- `$STORM_HOME` - created by package, stores all the libs and storm executables in `lib` and `bin` subfolders
- `storm.local.dir` - should be created by user and mentioned in storm.yaml, by default `Â§STORM_HOME/storm-local` is used.

Checking the history of [this fpm-project](https://github.com/pershyn/storm-deb-packaging), initially `$STORM_HOME` was `/opt/storm`.
Then some of the forks used `/usr/lib/storm`,
then original maintaner used `/var/lib/storm`,
and another forks moved to use `/opt/storm`...

So, there was a bit of a chaos.

Storm distribution deviate from debian packaging conventions,
(like separating libs, and executables),
so all the stuff that has to do something with storm goes to one `$STORM_HOME` folder.

The dilemma is how to organize a package, due to different perception by admins
and storm developers:

```
  |                   | ADMINS (Debian)       | DEVELOPERS
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  | Binary files      | /usr/bin/*            | $STORM_HOME/bin/*
  | Librariers        | /usr/lib/storm        | $STORM_HOME/lib/*
  | Configs           | /etc/storm/           | $STORM_HOME/conf/*
  | Logback config    | /etc/storm/logback.xml| $STORM_HOME/logback/cluster.xml
  | Logs              | /var/log/storm        | $STORM_HOME/logs/*
  | Supervisors       | /etc/init.d/*         | N/A
  | storm.local.dir   | /var/lib/storm/*      | ? (e.g. /mnt/storm, see Links)

```
Also, there are 2 concepts - the software could be packaged or not-packaged.

There is also [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard aka FHS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard)
([here](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/)): that says `/opt` is for programs that are _not packaged_ and don't follow the standards. You'd just put all the libraries there together with the program.
That is the case when you want to install storm directly from archive.

Also, using the configuration files in this repository the storm becomes packaged
and starts to follow FHS. This is achieved by giving symlinks.

See below how `$STORM_HOME` folder looks like:

```
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 Jul 24 15:00 bin
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 34239 Jun 12 22:46 CHANGELOG.md
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    10 Jul 24 14:39 conf -> /etc/storm
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   538 Mar 13 00:17 DISCLAIMER

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    14 Jul 24 14:39 logs -> /var/log/storm
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   981 Jun 10 15:10 NOTICE

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    14 Jul 24 15:37 storm-local -> /var/lib/storm
```
`var/log/storm` and `/var/lib/storm` are owned by storm user, so processes that
are also running under storm user can write state and logs.

Also `/usr/bin/storm` points to `/usr/lib/storm/bin/storm`, so, after installation storm
is accessible from command line.

This gives a precise control on configurations, log files and binaries following FHS.
Also such a schema satisfies both developers and admins paradigms.

<a name="logging"></a>
### Logging

By default storm shipped pre-configured to log into ${storm.home}/logs/
This configuration is done in `logback.xml`.

because `${STORM_HOME}/logs/` are symlinked to `/var/log/storm` they end up where expected by admins.

#Dependencies and Requirements:



<a name="compile-time-dependencies"></a>
### Compile time dependencies:

Provisioning script `bootstrap.sh` installs all needed dependencies for Debian-based distribution to build a package.
Same script is used to provision Vagrant environment.

<a name="vagrant"></a>
#### Vagrant (Optional)

The [vagrant-debian-wheezy-64](https://github.com/dotzero/vagrant-debian-wheezy-64)
scripts were used to create a vagrant box, called `wheezy64`.
This box is used as a base env to build package. You can also use `ubuntu` box.

It is recommended to use vagrant to automatically provision the machine to build
the script. (relies on `wheezy64`)

```bash
# prepare and enter vm (debian)
vagrant up debian
vagrant ssh debian
# to build in ubuntu use `vagrant up ubuntu && vagrant ssh ubuntu`

cd /vagrant
# and then use commands from _Usage_ section.
```

Probably the other debian-based distribution can be used as well, if you don't have wheezy box.

<a name="todo"></a>
## TODO:

- Ensure python 2.6.6 and java6/7 are added to package dependencies so they get installed automatically.
- clean-up storm-local on package removal, so it doesn't collide with further installations
- storm user home??? ($STORM.HOME is owned by root.)
- check package installation behavior when home folder exists.
- https://wiki.debian.org/MaintainerScripts
- Setup continious builds for storm-master? Would be cool if I can just download a package and not whole virtual machines and environment, etc.:-)

Also, interesting materials related to this repository.
* according to [this discussion](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=621833) debian package should not remove any users on removal. Recommended behaviour is disabling a user.
* [This](http://serverfault.com/questions/96416/should-i-install-linux-applications-in-var-or-opt) is a good answer "where should software be installed".
